    <h1> About Braids by Nicole</h1>

<div class="pragraph" style= "padding-left: 80px;  padding-right: 80px;">
    <p>In the eighth grade, I observed a trend among female students where they wore Dutch braids, which I found aesthetically pleasing and desired to replicate. </p> 
	 
	 <p>However, I encountered challenges in achieving the desired outcome, prompting me to seek alternative methods.</p> 

        <p>Through experimentation and research, I discovered that the technique was not as intricate as initially perceived.</p>

        <p>As my expertise in braiding developed, I have conducted extensive research by viewing various instructional videos on YouTube.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, I gained practical experience by practicing on friends and family members.</p>
        
        <p>My passion for braiding led me to establish my own business, where I now offer braiding services as both a hobby and a profession.</p>
