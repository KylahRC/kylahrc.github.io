Note for commits:

Since Janika had difficulty pushing and pulling code to the repository, I (Kylah) did all the pushing.
I have done my best to differenciate who did what part by adding names to the commits.
If there is no name on the commit, assume it was me (Kylah).
I often forgot to add my name to the commit messages..

Appologies for the inconvenience.
